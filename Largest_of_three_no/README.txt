question : find largest of three numbers

logic :
we compare 3 conditions
    (a>b)and(a>c) = a is larger than b and c
    (b>a)and(b>c) = b is larger than a and c
    (c>a)and(c>b) = c is larger than a and b

    if none of the condion matches the the input it means numbers are equal 
    
exmaple input : findlarge(1,2,3)

example output : 3
